# Data format (fixed by the team; do not rename fields)

Read this before you read, write or convert a measurement, a wardrobe or a candidate.

Owned shirt:
```json
{
  "id": "blue-uniqlo-oxford",
  "label": "great",
  "measurements": { "chest_cm": 54, "length_cm": 72, "sleeve_cm": 63 }
}
```
- `label` is one of `"great"`, `"tight"`, `"loose"` (how the shirt fits its wearer).
- Centimeters, numbers not strings, rounded to 1 decimal. Inches are converted at input
  (x 2.54), never inside the engine.
- `chest_cm` is pit-to-pit measured flat (half the circumference). Every source must use this
  convention. Mixing flat and circumference is the #1 silent bug.
- Any measurement may be `null`. Code must handle `null` on every field.
- Chest (pit-to-pit / body width) is the trusted dimension — consistent across sources. Length and sleeve
  are only comparable within one convention: prefer a per-brand offset calibrated from a shirt the user
  owns (hand-measure it, compare to that brand's chart at the known size, store the difference, and apply
  it to that brand's charts). When no offset is known and the chart's convention can't be confirmed, set
  that dimension to null rather than mixing conventions.
- `id`: lowercase, dashes, no spaces, unique per person.

Candidate garment (used by the Pilot 1 engine; sizes listed smallest to largest):
```json
{
  "id": "cos-oxford",
  "name": "COS oxford",
  "review": "runs_small",
  "sizes": { "M": { "chest_cm": 55, "length_cm": 73, "sleeve_cm": 64 } }
}
```
`review` is one of `"runs_small"`, `"true_to_size"`, `"runs_large"`, or `null`.
